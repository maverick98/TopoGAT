            Summary

                This module is a 2-layer Graph Attention Network, but augmented by concatenating topological features 
                (data.topo) to node embeddings.

                The key novelty lies in injecting persistent homology-derived features 
                before feeding them into attention layers â€” enhancing the model's ability to 
                capture higher-order structural information.
