# TopoGAT: Topological Attention for Graph Representation Learning

TopoGAT is a novel graph neural network model that integrates persistent homology into the attention mechanism of GAT, enabling better representation learning through topological insights.

## Features
- Integration of persistent homology via topological embeddings
- Enhanced attention mechanism for GNNs
- Stable and expressive graph learning

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run example training:
```bash
python src/train.py
```
